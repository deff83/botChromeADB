   On the "Settings" tab, you can specify the external address of the KMS Service. Built-in 
 program service will not run when activated . If activation fails 0xc004f074, 
 make sure that your firewall does not prohibit a connection with your KMS-Service. 
 If you create a task scheduler for reactivation (in the program for this purpose is 
 special tab), the program can move wherever you want, you can even completely 
 remove it, it is not necessary to reactivate. 

               			Installing KMS-Service: 
                          —————————————————————————————————
   On the "Settings" tab you can install into the system KMS-Service, Windows 7-8 
 can be activated their own of it, if configured, 
 at the address 127.0.0.2:port, and on your network adress can be activated any systems and offices. 
 Installed server does not conflict with the task scheduler or manual activation, 
 if used buttons "Activate Windows" and "Activate Office". If your system is 8.1, on the process of 
 activation will be installed a special driver, which is removed at the end of activation. 
 For this configuration must be installed "== Integrated KMS-Service ==". 
 You can also configure the activation of an external server, upon activation by pressing the buttons at 
 Main program window your system settings are not changed, they will be restored immediately 
 after activation. 
 Using two buttons at the bottom window "Settings", you can view logfile of a running server. 

   			    "At me nothing activated !!!!" 
                          —————————————————————————————————
 Perhaps you have a non-VL product, which is not intended to activate using KMS-Service 
 (Windows 7 Ultimate this program does NOT ACTIVATE), or your antivirus blocks the activation.
